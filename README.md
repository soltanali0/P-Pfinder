## P-Pfinder: Explore Paths and Parameters with Ease
P-Pfinder is a powerful web tool designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of complex pathways and parameters within URLs. Whether you're a developer, cybersecurity analyst, or website optimizer, P-Pfinder offers valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of web content.

## Installation
To run P-Pfinder, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4
```
## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p-pfinder.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd p-pfinder
```
```bash
python app.py
```
Access P-Pfinder through your web browser at http://localhost:5000.

## How It Works
P-Pfinder offers two main functionalities: extracting parameters and paths from URLs. Users can access these features through simple API endpoints:

To extract parameters and paths from a specific domain, use the following endpoint:
```bash
http://localhost:5000)/extract-links?all=true&domain=https://example.com/page
```
This request will retrieve parameters and paths from the specified domain, utilizing web archive data if available.

To extract parameters and paths from a specific URL, use the following endpoint:
```bash
http://localhost:5000/extract-links?all=true&url=https://site.com/
```
This request will extract parameters and paths from the provided URL directly, analyzing the content of the page.
